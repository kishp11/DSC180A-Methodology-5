The most interesting topic was the cross betweeen data science and biology. There are so many computer scientists exploring this data. Deep learning in bioinformatics is cutting edge and innovative.

I would like to explore developing a deep learning model for predicting protein interactions from amino acid sequences.

I think using transfer learning and pre trained models could be better and more accurate.
